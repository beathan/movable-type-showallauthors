ShowAllAuthors uses a template parameter callback to change the list of authors (limited to 50 'recent' users) available in Manage -> Entries -> "Show only entries where user is...". Additionally, the list will contain names from bylines rather than account usernames to make sifting through a long list easier.

To install:
1. Copy to your MT plugins directory, e.g. "<your MT location>/plugins/"
2. Enjoy

Tested against MT4.31
